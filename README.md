-- Future features ideas to be implemented --

A user account system. I've already laid in the ground work with passport, just need to do the rest.

Attach the Chatbox to user accounts. I've already started with it using cookies to determine comment color.

Maybe some sort of blog posting system, a bit like twitter. 

Possibly some sort of small game, like Breakout or Pong. I would also implement a leaderboard for it, and attach it to the user accounts
