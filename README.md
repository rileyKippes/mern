-- Future features ideas to be implemented --

Add the ability to delete accounts. I need to add this before go live, for gpdr stuff.

Maybe some sort of blog posting system, a bit like twitter. 

Possibly some sort of small game, like Breakout or Pong. I would also implement a leaderboard for it, and attach it to the user accounts
